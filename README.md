# tinyrt
`tinyrt` is a personal learning project to improve my understanding of [ray tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) and become familiar with the [Qt framework](https://doc.qt.io/).

It uses Qt for the UI with [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-index.html) and [QImage](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qimage.html) to load assets, as well as to display and export the render.
The ray tracer itself was built from scratch and does not use Qt libraries.
